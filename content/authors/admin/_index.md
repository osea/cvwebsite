      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Yuntao WANG is an associate professor (research track) in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ "THU-CS"), where he works in the [Pervasive Interaction Lab](http://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ "PI") on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and ubiquitous computing. Dr. Wang’s research focuses on efficient behavioral computing and interaction intention inference on edge devices. Using the user’s motorial and physiological spatiotemporal features as the Bayes prior knowledge, he researches novel on-device continuously behavioral and physiological sensing methods and techniques, thus efficiently inferring the user’s interaction intention using multi-modal sensing data. Then, he develops edge intelligent sensing techniques and systems targeting high-impact application domains, including health and accessibility. He has published more than 60 conference or journal papers including ACAM CHI, IMWUT, UIST, etc. Seven of his papers were recognized as best paper or honorable mentioned awards. Among young scholars under age 35, he publishes the most IMWUT (Ubicomp, CCF A) journal papers. He has 24 granted patents including 10 WIPO/US patents. Dr. Wang's research work was recognized by the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) in 2022, the First Prize of Science and Technology Award of the Chinese Institute of Electronics (CIE) in 2019, the Excellent Innovation Award of the Chinese Association of Artificial Intelligence (CAAI) in 2021, and the second prize of X-prize competition in 2018.
